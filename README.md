# 2d-game-immersive-prototype

In the present work, possibilities are to be tested to what extent interaction objects can be embedded more immersively in 2D games. A game was programmed in which three different effects were tried out and tested by subjects. After the concept of immersion in computer games and the explanation of preattentive perception, the implementation of the 2.5D prototype will be discussed. Finally, the feedback of the test persons will be evaluated and summarized in the conclusion.

This project was developed by Marvin Kullick at the Hochschule f√ºr Wirtschaft und Technik in Berlin, Germany and supervised by Professor Doctor Tobias Lenz.
